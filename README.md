## Project Description
This project is a responsive landing page built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to create a modern, clean UI that is fully customizable and scalable. The page is suitable for showcasing products or services and easily adapt for different use cases.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router DOM**: For managing client-side routing.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```sh

   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The app will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage
- **Development**: Start the server using `npm start.` You will be able to see your changes in real time on `localhost`.
